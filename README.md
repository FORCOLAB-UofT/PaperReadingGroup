# Paper Reading Group
The paper reading group meets weekly during the semester to discuss papers. Participation is open to all, guests are always welcome; if you are interested in receiving invitations contact the organizer.

Each week we will discuss a different paper. The paper to discuss is announced about one week in advance by the organizer. All participants are expected to read the paper before the meeting. It is recommended to take notes about insights, questions, and other points potentially worth discussing.

The goals of the reading group are:

- Critical reflection on scientific work
- Practice of reading and argumentation strategies
- Exposure to a broad range of research topics
- Practice of leading group discussions

The discussion is limited to one hour. The discussion is led by a moderator, who may also set a focus for the discussion. The moderator will kick off the meeting by giving a short summary of the paper and raising a few points for discussion. The moderator should try to incorporate all participants into the discussion. The moderator role rotates through all participants. The moderator is encouraged to help with the selection of a paper that week.
